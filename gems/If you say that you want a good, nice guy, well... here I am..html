This is a very, very long post, I know. So if you don't like to read, then this is not your post. I have no problem with its length. I'm just trying to be clear and weed out some of the people and not waste anyones time. I have put some thought and effort into it, as you can see. I hope that it does not sound mean, rude, as if I'm better than anyone or stuck up. I hope that someone reads the whole thing and thinks that it was worth it, if only for its entertainment value alone. To the right person I know it's worth it. Its also worth it if you want to know a good man, what a good man is like, how a good man should act or how a good man should treat you. At the least, make it through the first 5 paragraphs (c'mon... give it a try... I'll give you a cookie). You may find yourself wanting to make it further. Think of it as a kind of challenge, if you must, a dare even, if you will. A double dog dare. (If you never dare, what will you gain?)<br>
<br>
So, realize it's long and gonna take some time, so... get yourself something... a snack, a sandwich, a drink... a cool washcloth. Sit yourself down, kick back... relax... get comfy, it really will be over sooner than you think. Please don't be put off by it's length. I'm hoping that you can and do, appreciate it. Don't feel like you have to read it all now, you could read the rest later (hahaha). It's not as long as it looks though and it's very informative, about me. This could be the last post, in this section that you ever have to, or decide to, read. Wouldn't that be great!? Besides that, nobody reads as much as they should anymore (okay, I made that part up). This post is definitely not for the SASC people out there. (Short Attention Span Challenged, hahaha, sorry, no offense meant, hell, they didn't even make it this far probably, hahaha.) Oh, and there will be a quiz at the end. (hahaha, look at how many girls just left... ran at the first challenge, hahaha, c'mon now, that's funny!)<br>
<br>
I ask for the information that I ask for; (a) to know you read my whole post, and (b) to make things simpler, quicker, easier for everyone, and (c) to weed out bots, spam and scams (and you would think, that the sheer length of this post alone would do it, but no such luck.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry if I don't make myself clear or you don't understand the things I say. I'm hoping that you do, or that you'll write and ask me questions if you don't. I am willing to clarify anything that I've written here, in a message, text, or on the phone if you'd like, no problem. Please don't mistake my candid honesty as mean, rude, or as disrespect. And please, do not mistake my complete kindness as a weakness.<br>
<br>
(Notice the capital letters here&gt;&gt;) OKAY, I CAN NOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH, PLEASE DO NOT WRITE ME WITHOUT HAVING READ MY WHOLE POST! YOU WILL NOT GET A REPLY, AND IT'S A WASTE OF YOUR TIME!<br>
<br>
I live in the Cincinnati area. I am real though, no spammer would put in this much effort just to make a few cents a click.<br>
<br>
I'm looking for a female, who is nice to be around or at least nice to me. I don't really have a 'type' I guess. For me, attraction has many layers and facets, it's a combination of all kinds of things. The last girl I dated, as a girlfriend was 24. I am open in age range, that really doesn't matter to me. To one of my ex's, camping meant no room service (not really my fault, but some I guess, I may have spoiled her a bit, sometimes, but I don't see that as a problem). I know that you may not need a man or want a man to take care of you, but sometimes, a MAN, should WANT to do what he can for you, to help you, to be there for you, be THAT person for YOU in your life. Just when it seems to be you against the world, BOOM, from out of nowhere. you feel a hand in yours, and there's your MAN, not just any man, but YOUR MAN, standing there, right with you...ready, to be there for you if you need him.<br>
<br>
I don't mind to be there for people who are important to me. That doesn't always just mean monetarily, that's across the board. I am not desperate by any idea, believe me, I'm just curious to see who else is out there. I am truly a fun, good, genuine, honest, loyal, respectful and nice guy. But remember, that also sometimes means telling you something that you may not, or do not, want to hear. It's hard to hear things sometimes, I know, and I'm sorry. Don't believe it, write me and find out for yourself, (feel free to ask people that know me as well, whether they like me or not). They at least respect me because of the person that I am. I have plenty going on for myself in my life. I just thought I would give this a try... to see what happens, and well, you never know.<br>
<br>
I am a good looking white guy, and have longer (to the shoulders) curly light brown hair, hazel eyes (my friends claim that they are green sometimes), and I am 6'+ tall, at apprx. 200lbs right now. I am not fat, think more, tall and slender. I play beach/sand volleyball sometimes in the summers, and I had played in a few tournaments years ago. I go to the AVP almost every year. and attend other sports. I used to box some, and I still have all of my own equipment in my home (minus a ring, but I do have access to one), but I absolutely abhor violence, except in sports where you assume some reasonable risks. I have some formal fight training, which came with lots of discipline, and I do not ever fight to prove myself or to show off. I do not skateboard and skate as much as I used to (very very rare now), and not in my home (okay, well...sometimes I did). In the the past years I have gone to see some friends who were on the Action Sports Tour (the Dew Tour), days of fun, it is badass. You can see a few pics of me, and them online (unfortunately). I say 'unfortunately' because I don't like to have my picture taken unless I can be in control of its use, but they happened so fast I wasn't able to move out of the way to say 'no thanks', politely. I enjoy lots of other sport activities, not limited to snowboarding, motocross, surfing, football, etc, but I am not the typical jock type.<br>
<br>
I really listen all kinds of music, but it could never tell you anything about me because my tastes in it are quite varied. I like live music and I am lucky enough to get to go to lots of shows/concerts, and I would want you to go too, when you are interested. I have some musician friends, both local and international, but I buy my own tickets because I don't like to mooch.<br>
<br>
I have my own homes, several cars (some are for show, but I'm not into it), and some motorcycles (got rid of one, got another one). I'm thinking of getting some toys for the water because I found a decent place, kind of close, for them. I'm not saying this to impress anyone, just more things that I enjoy, and I think it's informational. I work a lot, and I like to do fun stuff to enjoy myself. I like fun, but I also know when it's time to be responsible and take care of business.<br>
<br>
If you are looking to just be friends with me, thank you, but don't write, I'm sorry. I already have female friends and I am not looking to expand that circle (and I meet others often). I am open to casual dating or a serious relationship, but I would prefer something monogamous, that ultimately is leading toward a relationship with someone. Please only write if you want to date, leading to a monogamous relationship. If we find that we are better off as friends down the road, then that's a different story and completely okay.<br>
<br>
I spent many years teaching and working with multi-handicapped children. If you have kids, that doesn't bother me, but I don't have any. (I do have friends that act like children, so that's kind of like having them sometimes, I think, right? hahaha)<br>
<br>
I strive to be a good person in all aspects of my everyday life and always seek to do, and be, my best. I see nothing wrong with that. I do have flaws though. I prefer to tell the truth to the best of my knowledge and abilities. I have no problem with, and I like, proving the things that I say. It makes my life easier most times. (ask me something, if you think I'm not telling the truth you can call me on it, I will prove it to you, I can prove everything/anything I say, if you need me to, no problem) Very few people have ever known anyone like me.<br>
<br>
I have a whole cool, fun life to share with the right person. I've got all kinds of events and stuff to do and go to, sometimes 2-3 times a month, more during holidays, and would like someone else to show up with besides the usual friends. I do/can go almost anywhere and enjoy myself, sometimes it just takes the right person or people. I am asked, invited to, and attend all kinds of things, as my interests are quite varied. I am asked to attend some events where I have to dress up nice and occasionally (ugh), some that require a tuxedo. (I have 2 that were made for me, with lots of accessories. For the record, I prefer French cuffs. Yeah... I'm an outlaw, hahaha) So, occasionally that might mean shopping, and maybe a new outfit, but don't worry, I got it.<br>
<br>
If we do go out, I will do my best to show you a good time and I'll take great care of you and anything/everything you need. You must be able to try and enjoy going out, at least occasionally. I don't see anything wrong with two people enjoying each others company. I think its important to be comfortable around someone and enjoy their company. I think that people who enjoy each others company can have fun doing just about anything. I would always do my best to not put you in situations where you are uncomfortable or not at ease. I will try not to leave you standing in a room full of strangers by yourself for very long, if at all. I will not stand you up. (without having a very good reason, and letting you know as soon as possible, of course) Also in the interests of full disclosure, I may be a little late on occasions (but again, I will let you know as soon as I can and make it up to you).<br>
<br>
I am a one woman man and I know how to treat a woman right. I'm hoping that I can make you feel as special as you are, being attentive, conscious and thoughtful to the little things and your needs. I do not want to, and I will not try to, control you, but I will try to help you though, if you need it, if you want it and if you tell me so. I have enough problems controlling myself sometimes, hahaha, but I do it anyways. I like to say what I mean, and mean what I say. I do not say things for effect, or things that I don't mean, that I will recant, or take back later. I try not to have regrets in the things that I say. I do not want to tell you how to live your life, though I may make a suggestion here and there that I think could benefit you, or us, without bias, or without some way of only benefiting me, without any ulterior motives (I figure, if I help you make your life easier/better, then you may help me make mine easier/better too). You can take my advice if you want to, or not, no problem, it's just advice, you do what you want with it (but, you may be open for mocking on occasions, when you won't cry and it's okay to mock you. hahaha). My thought is, If I help you make space in your life, maybe you'll let me have a little of that space for us, if that makes any sense. If nothing else, I hope to restore your faith that a good, kind, nice, chivalrous, genuine man still exists (am I the last one?).<br>
<br>
This is not my only means of meeting women, it's just another one. Some women may be looking for a 'nice guy' that they can take advantage of (you know who you are and I am pointing a finger at you, hahaha), to buy them stuff, give them money, walk on, or to pay their bills, and good luck with that. (I may do those things anyway for you, just don't ask so quick)<br>
<br>
It may take time if I'm going to get back to you after your first message to me. I get busy and life happens. I'll get to it as I have time, I promise you, but I may not get back to some as fast as they want. If I don't respond to you, AND you responded as I asked, AND it's been a few days, I apologize. FEEL FREE TO WRITE ME AGAIN, I don't know what could have happened. If you have written and not gotten a response from me, I'm sorry. It may be because you haven't READ THE WHOLE POST, and I noticed, and/or you are not sending all the information, as I have nicely/politely asked. (but it could be me of course, I will admit, hahaha)<br>
<br>
Don't write me and have me writing to you, putting in time and effort, and then just stop writing and not tell me why you have not written back, it's rude and I won't chase you after that. If we are talking and you lose interest, be nice and just tell me, instead of leaving me wondering. I'm a big boy and I can take a hint, if you give one, but I don't want hints, just have common courtesy and tell me. I just think that something like that is totally disrespectful and rude. My thing is that if you don't like what you hear or you get bored and you no longer want to talk or respond, that's okay, but let me know, out of common courtesy. Tell me, instead of leaving me guessing what has happened to you. I think that's just not right for many reasons. It's not a nice thing to do and you know who you are (and again, I'm pointing a finger at you... a different you), actually you don't know, but I thought that was funny.<br>
<br>
So now, its your turn. If you write, give me something to work with... tell me a little about you. Maybe some likes, dislikes, pet peeves or things you do for fun. Maybe even something you would like to go and do. I might be able to make it happen, within reason, of course. Tell me about your deal breakers. Some short blurb. Anything.<br>
<br>
The girl I'm looking for would be white (no, that does not make me a racist), somewhat height/weight proportional, I guess, I don't know really, shape or size does not matter to me really, it's you, inside. You like fun, sometimes at least. You are not a liar. You are not mean for fun. You are not rude or nasty without reason. (If YOU know you ARE these things, DON'T CONTACT ME and waste each others time). You should just basically be kind of a good person, you don't have to be a saint (I know I'm not), just NOT any of the above. (who just quit reading? hahaha)<br>
<br>
You have had enough of the boneheads, assholes, dumbasses, douchebags, morons and idiots. You are ready to meet a REAL MAN, who is also kind, nice, genuine, cool, compassionate, honest, loyal, fun, respectful and, I have been told... somewhat sensitive. (ugh!)<br>
<br>
I will put in as much effort into this relationship as I possibly can and I hope you will too. My time is valuable, just like yours is as well, I'm sure. At first, if you really want to talk, just make sure that you are really ready to talk and can give a little bit of your attention and time to our conversations, as I will be giving you mine. I will be paying attention to what you have to say and I would want you to pay a little attention to what I have to say, and be able to follow the conversation as well. I would want to know that we are paying attention to each other. I would be taking my time to talk to you, you should be putting in some effort as well. I think that it shows your interest in me, and the person that I am, and its just nice.<br>
<br>
I am interested in your complete thoughts in messages and when we text or talk, and not just one or two word answers to questions so that there is no miscommunication (more on that later, keep reading. hahaha). I don't think that those things are asking too much. I like to finish conversations so that they have an end. When it comes to problems, I believe in talking together, solving those problems, coming to conclusions and moving on from there, so that there is nothing residual left to deal with. I prefer to be clear on, or about the things that we discuss, so that we both know, and are on the same page about it.<br>
<br>
A picture is not required for a reply, but this information* about yourself is a MUST in your first message (don't worry, it's nothing more than the stuff that I could see if I saw you walk into a room somewhere); *height ('I'm tall', doesn't work, at 6'+, I am tall, unless you are taller than me, give it please, in feet and inches, metric if you need to. I don't care, I know how to convert), or guess; *weight, ('I'm of average build', 'average' to you, may not be 'average' to me, everyone knows 'about' how much they weigh or has a guess about it, don't worry about what it is, I don't care if other guys have told you you are too 'thin' or 'heavy', let me decide for me), please, give it in pounds, metric, stone, whatever (again, if you need to, I know how to convert them... I know, skills right) or just guess; *hair (means color and long or short, I'm hoping you don't have to guess at this, hahaha). Oh, and a 200 word MINIMUM essay is required for a reply (hahaha, just kidding, come on now, get off it, that there was funny. I wonder how many people just quit reading!? hahaha, good!). Let me decide what counts you out or if you're my type or not, please. Here is something important, NOT giving any of the info* I'm asking for definitely counts you out and you WILL NOT get a response from me at all, no matter how, cute, funny, witty, clever or irreverent you are trying to be, and even with a picture (obviously, I want that info* in your first message, hahaha). If you do not send all the info* that I am asking for in your first message to me, you WILL NOT hear from me at all, I promise (no, really, I mean it). If you are not going to send the info* that I'm asking for, why are you going to waste your time to write to me over and over and over? (finger pointing) Seriously though, not sending all the info* that I'm asking for, and writing, is a complete waste of your time, but it is your time to waste. (I know that you don't understand it now, but you will, I promise, I have my reasons, for the first time, trust me)<br>
<br>
You'll send a picture of you before we meet (this is flexible somewhat... somewhat, I said) and of course I'll send you one back, don't worry. You don't have to send it now, but you can if you want. When you write and send the info* (once again, if you don't give ALL of the info*, I know, you can't believe that I'm going to say it again, you WILL NOT get any response, no matter what your message says), *say something about what part of town you're from, or at least near, so I know you really are local to me, let's say up to an hour or so away (another must, it also helps weeds out people who haven't read the post up to this point). *Also please write me with only your name in the subject line, you can use your first name or a nickname is fine (okay, sorry, so one more, it also weeds out more people who don't read the post, if you can believe they made it this far and don't finish it, you would be wrong...'REALLY!?', you say... I know right... I can't believe it either) so it doesn't go to my spam mailbox. (and it will go there, I WILL NOT EVER even see ANY responses without just a name in the subject line, because I set up message filters for them to go to a spam/trash mailbox) Then, I may also send you a picture back, if you sent me one (but you need to send me your picture first, to get a picture of me).<br>
<br>
I would prefer to have a few messages at first, to find out a few basics about each other, but not to do endless messages before we move on to texting (depending on your comfort level and our getting to know each other), then get to where we will talk on the phone. I am not interested in only texting for months. If you don't ever plan on talking on the phone, then don't waste the time.<br>
<br>
I could have made this post vague, and short, and gotten more responses, but I would prefer to get fewer responses of closer to what I want and go through those, and not waste your time. Quality over quantity I guess. This post is very, very long I know, but not hard to understand I think (maybe), and very simple to reply to, if you really read it. There are no hidden meanings or tricky statements. I tried to write what I meant. I do know that some of the things I've written may not translate as well to being read. Sorry for that, but I tried.<br>
<br>
After you get my message back, then you can decide what you want to do, have more messages (again, it's about your comfort level), text some or talk on the phone. You can always call me with your number blocked, just let me know in advance. Talking on the phone comes only when you are comfortable and ready, no rush. Then eventually meet, or not (your choice, at least let me know).<br>
<br>
If we meet and click, great. If not, no hard feelings, no harm done, and at least we had fun. We may even become friends. I do have female friends, a couple I've actually met online, crazy enough, so who knows. And to be clear, they are just friends, I do not fool around with any of them in any way, shape or form. They are like my guy friends to me in that respect, and I would not fool around with any of them (hahaha).<br>
<br>
Our first meeting will be in a public place. (`cause you scare me. Hell, you just read all of this didn't you...just kidding, it's for your comfort and safety... see, I'm already looking out for you, hahaha) We will talk on the phone before we meet, I will NOT meet anyone, anywhere, for any reason, that I haven't spoken to on the phone previously, sorry. Some things just don't translate as well when in written form, I think you have to hear them.<br>
<br>
You never believed that a truly kind, nice, genuine, honest, loyal, chivalrous, respectful guy existed, yet, here I am (like Santa, leprechauns, the Yeti, a merman (c'mon) or the Easter bunny). If you have always said you want a good, kind, nice guy, like me, write me, send your info*, and we'll see if its true. If you think I am not sincere, write me, send your info* and find out, you'll see for yourself. What will matter in how you view, judge or treat people? Why?<br>
<br>
Also (I know, sorry, it's almost over), I am not interested in seeing a webcam, being a booty call, sex with you while your ?boyfriend?/?girlfriend?/?husband/?wife?, watches, (besides, who does that that loves you anyway?), joining a website, paying you for; your 'time', 'company' or to 'hang out' with you (you really should be paying me), 'massages' of any kind, 'sexting' or 'cyber' anything, with anyone, in any way... regardless.<br>
<br>
If you read this whole post, I thank you for your time, and at the least I hope you enjoyed reading my post/novel/dissertation. It probably shouldn't be this long but it is (I have been known to go off on a tangent here and there, and be a bit verbose or loquacious at times, but it is all for the sake of clarity, I swear it is, hahaha, no really it is). There is way more to me than these few paragraphs could ever tell you. I am probably single because I am somewhat picky about who I let into my life, who I choose to trust and how they act, and really, I am in no rush at all (and maybe because I like to be clear, hahaha, look at where this has got me). I am a very private person, and I value that, if you can believe it from this tome.<br>
<br>
And please, don't write and say that you may not be 'good enough' for me, whoever has told you that you weren't good enough for them is probably wrong. (let alone an ass, probably a huge ass) So again, please let me make my own decisions. Please do not presume to know, who I am, how I will act, what I will know, how I will feel, what I will do or anything about me unless you have gotten the information from me or have known me longer than many others. Please do not judge me by the actions of others. I am my own man. If you like me and I like you, we'll make that decision, and work it out, together.<br>
<br>
If we have already talked some or gone out before and we don't speak now, I'm sure there is a reason and there is no reason to write again. You don't have to write me and tell me how I should give your girl friend another chance and how 'special' she is to YOU either. I'm sure there is a reason that her and I don't talk, have fun or go out places any more and I'm sure that her and I have already discussed the reason(s) why, so you should talk to HER about it. So, stop writing me (finger pointing). And don't write me thinking things have changed, unless they really truly have (and you know that they really haven't, don't you...) (more finger pointing).<br>
<br>
You also don't have to write me to tell me you think my post is silly, or dumb, or too long, I am okay with it, I wrote it. I'm sorry if you don't like it, but hey, I do thank you for reading, I mean really... c'mon, look at how far you made it... I know right, I can't believe it either (hahaha).<br>
<br>
So you can see that I have put a good bit of time into this and I put a lot on here to talk about, so when you respond, and I don't mind a short first email, but I would appreciate a little more than, 'Hi, you sound great/awesome/fun/too good to be true, or when can we get together?', when you write. I've heard all of those things before and more (they are all true, just so you know, hahaha). Thank you for thinking all those things, by the way. Even though there is a lot here, believe me, there is lots more to talk about. This is just what I'm willing to say in public. (hahaha)<br>
<br>
And, I can't believe that I even have to say this, but please don't spend most of our first time out together messing with your phone, unless there's a good reason, I won't. But if you do, no matter how cute you think you are, I will end our date early. No one is so cute to me that I will put up with that (bullshit) the first time out. I mention this because, I met a girl recently, who was really cute and everything, but she spent a good part of our first/only time out together playing with her phone and then wondered why I ended our date early, and why I said that I did not want to see her again. She said that I was stupid for not wanting to go out with her again (hahaha). I think/know she's wrong.<br>
<br>
Also (see, I told you that you should know better by now, hahaha), speaking of texting, just a brief moment to touch on that subject. (Okay well, by now, you should know that it will not be 'just a brief moment'). I feel that texting is for short, quick notes or thoughts, back and forth with short, quick answers, when talking on the phone is not convenient because of work or environmental factors. If you have time to text me for 10 - 20 plus minutes, steady, then we should be talking on the phone. If we are going to text and in that time we could talk then I would prefer to talk. I think that sometimes, so much is lost in a text message and I can say what I want to say and get that idea across quicker than texting it. When reading casual text, sometimes, miscommunications, misinterpretations and misunderstandings can happen far too often, but when you actually hear the tone, passion, and inflection in someones voice, misinterpretation does not occur as much. Also, I find it's harder for people to lie when they talk on the phone, and there is something about hearing the words coming out that I prefer.<br>
<br>
An email can be for longer communications or thoughts, again, when the phone is not convenient. In my opinion, neither of those should ever be used for any type of remorse, cancellations, apologies or 'I'm sorry's' of any kind. Those types of things should never come in the form of a text message or an email anyway, that's the chicken shit way out of not talking to someone, being apologetic, feeling stupid and embarrassed, and to me, is not an apology at all.<br>
<br>
As you can guess, talking is best for any and all communications. As I said, to me, the voice does not lie, the words can, but the voice does not I think (yea, that's right, I said it. hahaha). You can't just stop answering someone when you are on the phone with them, unless you pretend that the call dropped, you have to actually hang up on them (or rub the mic lightly with the pad of your finger and say loudly/quietly that you are 'going in a tunnel', but I would never do that, hahaha)<br>
<br>
Alright, I'm done (no, really, I am, I promise this time). If you liked what you read in this post about me so far, you should write and send your info*, you have nothing to lose in writing me. Hell, if you made it this far, why wouldn't you write? What's YOUR problem (hahaha)!? You may write and say that I 'sound too good to be true', but let me assure you that I am guaranteed the real deal. I am everything I say and more, and everything I've said here is the truth. This is just the tip of the iceberg, so to speak. If you stereotyped me after reading this, then you probably have a surprise coming. I hope that you don't feel as though reading this was a waste of your time. (By the way, if you read this far, and are wondering about it... there is no quiz, hahaha, sorry. I just thought that it was funny. Did you skip ahead to find it? Awesome... now that's funny. hahaha).<br>
<br>
I know the one girl I'm looking for is out there, I know she is. It's just a matter of if she ever see's this post, bothers to read the whole thing and has the guts to write (hahaha). I'm not doing this to 'get laid', and I wouldn't have to post here for that. I am going out on dates, having fun and enjoying myself. If you see this post, then I am still single (unfortunately), unattached, and trying to change that. This post will not exist when I start dating someone, because I am only looking for one. I know that sounds sappy, sorry, but it's true.<br>
<br>
Talk to you soon. Make it a great day. (that is a non-denominational statement of course, hahaha) Take care.<br>
<br>
THIS IS THE END, AREN'T YOU HAPPY! (You know you are! hahaha) NOW WRITE ME! (hahaha)<br>
<br>
p.s. Can you believe that this is the "edited" version? hahaha
