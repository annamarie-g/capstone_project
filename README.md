Predicting User Age from Craigslist Personals Postings 

On a given day there are over 500,000 craiglist.org personals posted across the US. For my project I am using craigslist personals data to identify key features in predicting a user's age. Processing methods applied to the text involve detecting native language, use of slang, and writing style. I am also applying clustering techniques to make matches between users based on their post.
