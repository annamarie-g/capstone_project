I bought it a few months ago from someone who wanted to switch to an electric smoker. I typically build my own and I just bought this one more or less to review and see how it cooked and see if there were any design elements that I liked that I could apply to my own designs. It is a perfect size for home use. I have performed about a dozen cooks on it. It takes about 30-40 minutes from the time I light charcoal until the time I load food into it. Over the coarse of the next hour I monitor the temp every 10-15 minutes and after that it holds itself steady. I once ran it for 6 hours at 250 without touching the intake valve once. If you are willing to learn the art of cooking with a wood fired smoker it really isn't any more difficult than running a propane smoker. Add a BBQ Guru and it is just as easy as an electric, but it tastes much better than both!\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nI'd probably rank condition 6-7 out of 10. It could use a new set of door seals, but they do work as is. There are a few scratches around it from moving it around. Also you can see a little of the smoke shadow on the cook chamber door from the previous owner cracking the firebox door open to try to cool it down (he didn't know how to use it and didn't have an intake valve on it). Everything else is in pretty good shape. I always lined the bottom of the cook chamber with foil and cooked my food either in a pan or with a drip pan below it so I didn't ruin the bottom surface. If you would like the wood base and caster wheels it is sitting on you can take them or leave them, it's your choice.

I bought it a few months ago from someone who wanted to switch to an electric smoker. I typically build my own and I just bought this one more or less to review and see how it cooked and see if there were any design elements that I liked that I could apply to my own designs. It is a perfect size for home use. I have performed about a dozen cooks on it. It takes about 30-40 minutes from the time I light charcoal until the time I load food into it. Over the coarse of the next hour I monitor the temp every 10-15 minutes and after that it holds itself steady. I once ran it for 6 hours at 250 without touching the intake valve once. If you are willing to learn the art of cooking with a wood fired smoker it really isn't any more difficult than running a propane smoker. Add a BBQ Guru and it is just as easy as an electric, but it tastes much better than both!\n\nI'd probably rank condition 6-7 out of 10. It could use a new set of door seals, but they do work as is. There are a few scratches around it from moving it around. Also you can see a little of the smoke shadow on the cook chamber door from the previous owner cracking the firebox door open to try to cool it down (he didn't know how to use it and didn't have an intake valve on it). Everything else is in pretty good shape. I always lined the bottom of the cook chamber with foil and cooked my food either in a pan or with a drip pan below it so I didn't ruin the bottom surface. If you would like the wood base and caster wheels it is sitting on you can take them or leave them, it's your choice. I am just going to through the wood in my wood stove if you don't take it and reuse the wheels for something else. If you have any questions please ask.

Better yet, save some money and buy this exceptional guitar from me. I am an aging guitar teacher slowly diminishing my stock of instruments to my students and the youngsters among us. This baby is a leftover from my days as a performer. \n\nThe guitar is a single resonator. If you don't know what a resonator is than this guitar is probably not for you. However, if you have a son or daughter who is completely obsessed with the guitar, this might make an excellent Christmas gift. A resonator is a special guitar. \n\nA resonator guitar sort of sounds like a combination between a harmonica and a guitar. Imagine if a guitar and a harmonica were to wed and have children~the instrument would sound like this!\n\nResonators are traditionally blues guitars. They were actually developed for the orchestral stage in the days before amplifiers. CCR loved resonators as does many a blues musician. These sound SaaaWEEET with a slide. If you don't have a slide, go get a three inch socket from the pawn shop (you think the old blues guys spent $35 on a blown glass slide in the deep South or the hills of Appalachia?!? No way!

The NW corner of the state is home to over half of the states 375,000 elk. If you come to Craig to see people you may as well stay home. \u003cbr/\u003e\nIf you came here to see elk don't waste another minute come see where the elk are made and the highest elk density in the world wraps around you like the glamor of nature at its finest. Colorado is home to the largest elk population in the world and within this big game hunting mecca, Moffat County boasts to two of the largest migratory elk herds in North America and is also a hunting hot spot for deer, antelope and small game. With over 20,000 acres to hunt on 7 different ranches you will be swimming in prime private land and enjoying the success it provides. \u003cbr/\u003e\nThat is important to an elk hunter but there continues to be more as Craig unfolds to welcome you in to the hunt of your life. Craig is a bustling town with an extremely strong pro guns attitude that is as strong as its pro-hunting attitude that is extremely refreshing in today's world. Friendly town it is, don't hesitate to say high when you meet someone on the street, they will certainly say hi back. The area is known for its record class Mule deer and not to be slighted the pronghorn Antelope that thrive here have the very rare genes to be able to put the sportsman that kills one in the Boone and Crockett or Pope and Young record book, not to mention SCI's book also.\u003cbr/\u003e\nTo hunt here you will want to be with a local, some one that was born and raised here living among these great animals and hunting them at a young age. Then becoming so proficient received his outfitting license early on and has many years of outfitting and guiding to show and build his skill and animal knowledge.\u003cbr/\u003e\nThis is your outfitter, a man that has probably seen more elk drop at a shot then most of us have ever seen anywhere at any time. His properties are vast and lay game full in in units GMU003, GMU301, and GMU441. Notice the unique regulation for GMU004 and GMU441 for archers. In those 2 GMU's have a unique archery clause? To hunt public land you must draw the license with the additional clause that states that if you are hunting Private Land in GMU004 and 441 you can use a over the counter archery license. This hunt is conducted on 20,000 acres of private land, so the over the counter archery license is valid for this hunt. Note many people are confused by this clause because it is unique to only about 5 units in the state.\u003cbr/\u003e\nIf you are in question feel free to contact the Colorado Parks and Wildlife at\n\u003ca class=\"showcontact\" href=\"/fb/csd/spo/5317899392\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"click to show contact info\"\u003eshow contact info\u003c/a\u003e\nfor confirmation. GMU003 and 301 is an archery over the counter private or public as most of the units are at this time. Colorado has some of the most complex license application in the nation, rules like this make up that complexity.\u003cbr/\u003e\nEarly seasons, September finds the elk in the high country for rut in GMU004 and GMU441. They will be dodging arrows and muzzleloader bullets as they hear the cow coal of many new ladies and the bugles of bulls that have never been heard in these parts as the archers and muzzleloader hunters try to mystify or harass the love sick bull to come within range of their primitive weapons.\u003cbr/\u003e\nWhen mid-August rolls out of the summer heat the archers and their tent blinds on waterholes begin to pop up like mushroom after a heavy rain. The antelope hunting all takes place in the flat to rolling terrain of GMU003 and GMU301. This is a great \"Low Impact\" hunt, one for the youth for his first big game animal or a senior citizen that has not given up and want to hunt with him boys and shoot antelope, the time and the success together will be cherished for the years that make up the rest of their lives.\u003cbr/\u003e\nWith September just a memory the Pronghorn antelope slips in under the cover of darkness during the 1st week in October and they are greeted by the antelope hunters toting rifles and the only tents by the water holes are the ones that the hunters are camped in during this usually mild weather.\u003cbr/\u003e\nThe deer and elk stay for the most part in the cooler temperatures in GMU004 and GMU441 for their archer, muzzleloader and first couple of gun seasons before the slowly migrate down to the Craig Valley floor where some will spend the winter and others continue south to the Yampa River Valley and Axel basin to spend the winter.\u003cbr/\u003e\nThis outfitter learned this migration pattern at an early age and knew that you had to have mountain private land as well as land in the valley if you wanted to hunt all three animals during all seasons.\u003cbr/\u003e\nThis is exactly what you will be hunting, where the animals that you have a license for are at the time of your season. Not be told \"they are not here yet, or they are below us like many are told each year by other outfitters. The words to remember,\" Don't miss the Flow!\"\u003cbr/\u003e\nThese hunts are all about having a safe and good hunt with a guide and outfitter that have lived here most if not all of their lives hunting and guiding this honey hole of hunting. The hunt includes the hunt, guided to the degree of semi-guided with both of you having the same goal, that is to meet the large Rocky Mountain Elk, the largest of the species face to face on his terms and to see who wins the right to brag or eat crow the next day depending on the outcome of the contacted opportunity. \u003cbr/\u003e\nLodging and meals are the hunters responsibility and the outfitter will provide you with motel phone numbers in Crag that he recommends for his hunters and where you will all meet for breakfast early the first morning to head out in the darkness together after plans with maps, guides and hunters all in the loop. This is the first day of the rest of your life. You are going out west on a famous Colorado elk hunt that will build memories that data confirms that hunters enjoy enough that they return year after year.\u003cbr/\u003e\nYou will be required to meet the outfitter at a prearranged location at a specific time early in the morning to start your hunt. If you are late and every one had gone stay in your car with your cell phone and depending on how the day goes they might be able to get back to you. Do not go in the property without the outfitter or guides knowledge.\u003cbr/\u003e\nTime has taught him about people or hunters. It is not a first time hunt for many and they mainly need access to private land where a \"Land Stewart\" has protected the land and made certain that the animals you are after are there when you get there.\u003cbr/\u003e\nHe does no advertise his hunts as 1 on 1 or 2 on 1 hunting, instead it is 3, 4 or even 5 on 1 hunting. This depends on the season and the number of hunters hunting that hunt. If you do want a 1 on 1 or a 2 on 1 there will be a price increase to provide that service. He provides a closer attentiveness to the newer hunter while allowing the more veteran hunters more leeway. If necessary the guide can work elk to the hunters but his only requirement is to check on the hunters once per day. As a norm he will assist you in elk hunting knowledge to direct you to the best places to be, hunt or sit depending on the time of year and where the elk are traveling. He is required by the landowners to always be with the group when anyone is hunting on the land. There is no DIY hunting allowed. He is very skilled and knowledgeable about hunting and hunters and as ones fill put more effort into the ones that have not filled. . . yet.\u003cbr/\u003e\nSome ask about the success rate for elk for the outfitter for the last few years. The success average across the 6 seasons varies every year due to the weather. Elk are very weather dependent for their migration. A good average is 60-75% harvest with 99.9 have at least 1 opportunity during the 5 day season, Archery, Muzzleloader, 1st rifle, 2nd rifle, 3rd rifle and 4th rifle. Archery being the lowest success due to the range restriction and 4th season the highest due to the compacting of the herds due to migration but weather can always be a factor in elk hunting.\u003cbr/\u003e\nMany reasons for the wide span are buck fever. Many hunters get it on deer. When you have an animal 3 times the size of a deer it is extremely apparent you must, must focus on the shoulder not the antlers when you shoot. We have antlers shot off many times because of this. I spoke with a hunter that didn't fill and he had shot 20 rounds, at 5 different bulls, 1 at 90 yards standing broad side and never hit an elk.\u003cbr/\u003e\nThe other reason is many are short range ground blind whitetail hunters. The farthest they have ever shot is 50 yards in eastern whitetail states. Because of this a 300 or even 200 yard shot is out of the question. We have had them refuse to shoot an elk standing at 200 yards because they felt it was too far. If they do shoot they shoot that far standing up instead of with a rest or better yet laying down.\u003cbr/\u003e\nI recommend everyone to shoot a 300 yards target before coming out west. An elk is huge with a chance twice the size of a deer. (15x15 vs 36x36) so in theory shooting an elk at 200 years is like shooting a deer at 100 yards. If you can do well on paper at 300 yards you will be one of the 75% not the 25%. I also recommend shooting laying down on the ground this skill is difficult for many to lay down on the ground when hunting but this or to some degree with a rest is an important skill to build. Finally getting from a walking position to down on the ground in a solid position with shooting sticks low or resting the forearm of the rifle on a solid rest is a times even with elk hunting. You only have so much time to get from walking to pulling the trigger before the bull moves of out of sight. These are free ranging elk not high fence elk. They will do everything possible for them to be difficult to shoot, and for that we have no control but will do our best to give you an opportunity for a shot.\u003cbr/\u003e\nI have personally hunted in this area for 35 years and never gone home without a elk. You can't find a denser population in the world then the private land you will be hunting in an area known as the elk capitol of the world. Even the public land elk move into the already high number on the private land as soon as the first shot is fired. The lead cow has been doing it for 15 years and they keep doing it generation after generations because it get so little pressure in comparison to the public land which is wall to wall blaze orange. The public land hunter does a good job of moving even more elk than we already have into our private property. Our private property is pre-scouted before the hunts and local herds spotted. Those have the public land herd by noon on the 1st day. Moving elk are a easier target than the local herds because they are not as familiar with the private property escape routes, while your guide is. If the elk are moving they are everywhere. Just like deer though if they decide to lay down and hold up they will still be there but must be spotted in their beds unless they get up to feed or migrate.\u003cbr/\u003e\nWould allow us to bring a self-contained RV to stay in on the property is a question we get asked but due to the fire danger during the hunting season which is usually announced by the forest service is extreme camping of any type is not allowed on the property. Better yet though is in the town of Craig is a KOA camp ground dedicated to hunters in the fall. It has a large game pole, for skinning and hanging you elk to cool. They provide anything that relates to hanging deer and elk along with hunting.\u003cbr/\u003e\n.\u003cbr/\u003e\nThis outfitter books up early each year so by now some slots are already filled.\u003cbr/\u003e\nThank-you\u003cbr/\u003e\nGreg\u003cbr/\u003e\nKeep-m the point required in your mind when you put in for a license this year. You can put in for an elk point then get a elk license over the counter when you arrive in Colorado for the 2nd or 3rd seasons.\u003cbr/\u003e\nIf you would like to shoot a mule deer there is only about a 50% chance of drawing one for private land with no points and you will be running into deer all day when you are elk hunting. I recommend putting in for a deer point this year so you will have one for next year or if you do want to hunt deer with your elk this year then put in for a deer and you will automatically either draw or get a point. Ask Greg for details on how you can build your points and hunt the best areas every year.\u003cbr/\u003e\nGMU003 \u0026amp; GMU301 hunting opportunities/Dates are approximate\u003cbr/\u003e\nDeer Seasons and Preference Points to Draw\u003cbr/\u003e\nArchery Either sex 0 points 08/31-09/29 \u003cbr/\u003e\nMuzzleloader Buck 2 points Doe 0 points 09/14-9/22 \u003cbr/\u003e\n1st Rifle Buck 0 Doe 0 None\u003cbr/\u003e\n2nd Rifle Buck 0 and doe 0 10/19-10-27 \u003cbr/\u003e\n2nd Rifle PL Either sex 0 and Doe 0 10/19-10-27\u003cbr/\u003e\n3rd Rifle PL Either sex 0 11/02-11/10 \u003cbr/\u003e\n3rd Rifle SPECIFY Buck or Doe 0 points 11/02-11/10\u003cbr/\u003e\n4th Rifle Buck Only 5 preference points 11/13-11/17 \u003cbr/\u003e\nPossible left over licenses in some categories announced in July and sold first come first serve in August\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nElk\u003cbr/\u003e\nArchery Bull, Cow or either 0 Points 08/31-09/29\u003cbr/\u003e\nMuzzleloader Either Sex 0 points or Cow 0 points 09/14-9/22\u003cbr/\u003e\nEarly Season Cow 1 point 10/12-10/16\u003cbr/\u003e\n1ST PL Cow 0 Points 10/12-10/16\u003cbr/\u003e\n1st Rifle Cow 0 Points either sex 0 Points 10/12-10/16\u003cbr/\u003e\n2nd Rifle Cow 0 points Bull Over the counter 10/19-10-27\u003cbr/\u003e\n3rd Rifle Cow 0 Points Bull over the Counter 11/02-11/10 \u003cbr/\u003e\n4th Rifle Cow 0 points 0 Points 11/13-11/17 \u003cbr/\u003e\nLate Cow 2 Points 12/01-12/31 \u003cbr/\u003e\nPossible left over licenses in some categories announced in July and sold first come first serve in August\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nAntelope\u003cbr/\u003e\nARCHERY Buck 3 Points Doe 0 points 08/15-09/20 \u003cbr/\u003e\nMuzzleloader Buck 8 Points and Doe 1 Point 10/21-10/29\u003cbr/\u003e\nREGULAR Buck 13 Doe 1 point 10/06-10/12 \u003cbr/\u003e\nRifle PL Buck 0 and Doe 0 Point 10/06-10/12 \u003cbr/\u003e\nIn the regulations on page 31 bottom right corner of the page is:\u003cbr/\u003e\n\"These Licenses are valid on private land in units 4,5,12,23,24,33 and 441.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\nThis is referring to, \"OVER-THE-COUNTER LICENSES EITHER-SEX ELK-ARCHERY\"\u003cbr/\u003e\nin the bottom left corner of the page.\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n-----------\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nGMU004 \u0026amp; GMU441 hunting opportunities/Dates are approximate\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nMuzzleloader is grouped with 3 for GMU004 \u0026amp; 441\u003cbr/\u003e\nArchery is grouped with 3 for GMU004 \u0026amp; 441\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nDeer Seasons and Preference Points to Draw\u003cbr/\u003e\nArchery Either sex 0 points 08/31-09/29 \u003cbr/\u003e\nMuzzleloader Buck 2 points 0 points 09/14-9/22 \u003cbr/\u003e\n1st Rifle Buck 0 None\u003cbr/\u003e\n2nd Rifle Buck 0 points 0 points 10/19-10-27 \u003cbr/\u003e\n2nd Rifle PL Either sex 0 points 0 points 10/19-10-27\u003cbr/\u003e\n3rd Rifle PL Either sex 0 points 0 points 11/02-11/10 \u003cbr/\u003e\n3rd Rifle Buck 0 points 1 points 11/02-11/10\u003cbr/\u003e\n4th Rifle Buck 5 points 12 points 11/13-11/17 \u003cbr/\u003e\nPossible left over licenses in some categories announced in July and sold first come first serve in August\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nElk\u003cbr/\u003e\nArchery Bull, Cow or either 0 Points 08/31-09/29\u003cbr/\u003e\nMuzzleloader Either Sex 0 points or Cow 0 points 09/14-9/22\u003cbr/\u003e\nEarly Season Cow 1 point 10/12-10/16\u003cbr/\u003e\n1ST PL Cow 0 Points 10/12-10/16\u003cbr/\u003e\n1st Rifle Cow 0 Points either sex 0 Points 10/12-10/16\u003cbr/\u003e\n2nd Rifle Cow 0 points Bull Over the counter 10/19-10-27\u003cbr/\u003e\n3rd Rifle Cow 0 Points Bull over the Counter 11/02-11/10 \u003cbr/\u003e\n4th Rifle Cow 0 points 0 Points 11/13-11/17 \u003cbr/\u003e\nLate Cow 2 Points 12/01-12/31 \u003cbr/\u003e\nPossible left over licenses in some categories announced in July and sold first come first serve in August\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nAntelope\u003cbr/\u003e\nARCHERY Buck 1 point 2 points 08/15-09/20 \u003cbr/\u003e\nMuzzleloader Buck 1 Points 1 Point 10/21-10/29\u003cbr/\u003e\nREGULAR Buck 1 Points 1 Point 10/06-10/12 \u003cbr/\u003e\nRifle PL Buck 1 point 2 Point 10/06-10/12 \u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nHistorical Leftover licenses after the License Application Draw.\u003cbr/\u003e\nDEER ELK ANTELOPE \u003cbr/\u003e\nDF004P5A EF003O2R None\u003cbr/\u003e\nEF00303R\u003cbr/\u003e\nEM00304R\u003cbr/\u003e\nEM00404R\u003cbr/\u003e\nEF004P1M\u003cbr/\u003e\nAlso 2nd and 3rd season Bull Elk Licenses are available over the counter.\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n* Indicate the seasons that can be hunted on this property.\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nPossible left over licenses in some categories announced in July and sold first come first serve in August.\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nIn all 4 units there is archery, muzzleloader, 1, 2, 3 and 4 hunting season.

From here you can drive to any place in the United States or even fly there. You are not only in the place where you hunt in the highest elk density in the world but you are in the legendary elk capitol of the United States, the famous Craig Colorado. From this town of 10,000 people draw an imaginary 100 mile circle and you will not find anywhere that a circle of this size can encompass so many elk. The NW corner of the state is home to over half of the states 375,000 elk. If you come to Craig to see people you may as well stay home. \nIf you came here to see elk don't waste another minute come see where the elk are made and the highest elk density in the world wraps around you like the glamor of nature at its finest. Colorado is home to the largest elk population in the world and within this big game hunting mecca, Moffat County boasts to two of the largest migratory elk herds in North America and is also a hunting hot spot for deer, antelope and small game. With over 20,000 acres to hunt on 7 different ranches you will be swimming in prime private land and enjoying the success it provides. \nThat is important to an elk hunter but there continues to be more as Craig unfolds to welcome you in to the hunt of your life. Craig is a bustling town with an extremely strong pro guns attitude that is as strong as its pro-hunting attitude that is extremely refreshing in today's world. Friendly town it is, don't hesitate to say high when you meet someone on the street, they will certainly say hi back. The area is known for its record class Mule deer and not to be slighted the pronghorn Antelope that thrive here have the very rare genes to be able to put the sportsman that kills one in the Boone and Crockett or Pope and Young record book, not to mention SCI's book also.\nTo hunt here you will want to be with a local, some one that was born and raised here living among these great animals and hunting them at a young age. Then becoming so proficient received his outfitting license early on and has many years of outfitting and guiding to show and build his skill and animal knowledge.\nThis is your outfitter, a man that has probably seen more elk drop at a shot then most of us have ever seen anywhere at any time. His properties are vast and lay game full in in units GMU003, GMU301, and GMU441. Notice the unique regulation for GMU004 and GMU441 for archers. In those 2 GMU's have a unique archery clause? To hunt public land you must draw the license with the additional clause that states that if you are hunting Private Land in GMU004 and 441 you can use a over the counter archery license. This hunt is conducted on 20,000 acres of private land, so the over the counter archery license is valid for this hunt. Note many people are confused by this clause because it is unique to only about 5 units in the state.\nIf you are in question feel free to contact the Colorado Parks and Wildlife at\nshow contact info\nfor confirmation. GMU003 and 301 is an archery over the counter private or public as most of the units are at this time. Colorado has some of the most complex license application in the nation, rules like this make up that complexity.\nEarly seasons, September finds the elk in the high country for rut in GMU004 and GMU441. They will be dodging arrows and muzzleloader bullets as they hear the cow coal of many new ladies and the bugles of bulls that have never been heard in these parts as the archers and muzzleloader hunters try to mystify or harass the love sick bull to come within range of their primitive weapons.\nWhen mid-August rolls out of the summer heat the archers and their tent blinds on waterholes begin to pop up like mushroom after a heavy rain. The antelope hunting all takes place in the flat to rolling terrain of GMU003 and GMU301. This is a great \"Low Impact\" hunt, one for the youth for his first big game animal or a senior citizen that has not given up and want to hunt with him boys and shoot antelope, the time and the success together will be cherished for the years that make up the rest of their lives.\nWith September just a memory the Pronghorn antelope slips in under the cover of darkness during the 1st week in October and they are greeted by the antelope hunters toting rifles and the only tents by the water holes are the ones that the hunters are camped in during this usually mild weather.\nThe deer and elk stay for the most part in the cooler temperatures in GMU004 and GMU441 for their archer, muzzleloader and first couple of gun seasons before the slowly migrate down to the Craig Valley floor where some will spend the winter and others continue south to the Yampa River Valley and Axel basin to spend the winter.\nThis outfitter learned this migration pattern at an early age and knew that you had to have mountain private land as well as land in the valley if you wanted to hunt all three animals during all seasons.\nThis is exactly what you will be hunting, where the animals that you have a license for are at the time of your season. Not be told \"they are not here yet, or they are below us like many are told each year by other outfitters. The words to remember,\" Don't miss the Flow!\"\nThese hunts are all about having a safe and good hunt with a guide and outfitter that have lived here most if not all of their lives hunting and guiding this honey hole of hunting. The hunt includes the hunt, guided to the degree of semi-guided with both of you having the same goal, that is to meet the large Rocky Mountain Elk, the largest of the species face to face on his terms and to see who wins the right to brag or eat crow the next day depending on the outcome of the contacted opportunity. \nLodging and meals are the hunters responsibility and the outfitter will provide you with motel phone numbers in Crag that he recommends for his hunters and where you will all meet for breakfast early the first morning to head out in the darkness together after plans with maps, guides and hunters all in the loop. This is the first day of the rest of your life. You are going out west on a famous Colorado elk hunt that will build memories that data confirms that hunters enjoy enough that they return year after year.\nYou will be required to meet the outfitter at a prearranged location at a specific time early in the morning to start your hunt. If you are late and every one had gone stay in your car with your cell phone and depending on how the day goes they might be able to get back to you. Do not go in the property without the outfitter or guides knowledge.\nTime has taught him about people or hunters. It is not a first time hunt for many and they mainly need access to private land where a \"Land Stewart\" has protected the land and made certain that the animals you are after are there when you get there.\nHe does no advertise his hunts as 1 on 1 or 2 on 1 hunting, instead it is 3, 4 or even 5 on 1 hunting. This depends on the season and the number of hunters hunting that hunt. If you do want a 1 on 1 or a 2 on 1 there will be a price increase to provide that service. He provides a closer attentiveness to the newer hunter while allowing the more veteran hunters more leeway. If necessary the guide can work elk to the hunters but his only requirement is to check on the hunters once per day. As a norm he will assist you in elk hunting knowledge to direct you to the best places to be, hunt or sit depending on the time of year and where the elk are traveling. He is required by the landowners to always be with the group when anyone is hunting on the land. There is no DIY hunting allowed. He is very skilled and knowledgeable about hunting and hunters and as ones fill put more effort into the ones that have not filled. . . yet.\nSome ask about the success rate for elk for the outfitter for the last few years. The success average across the 6 seasons varies every year due to the weather. Elk are very weather dependent for their migration. A good average is 60-75% harvest with 99.9 have at least 1 opportunity during the 5 day season, Archery, Muzzleloader, 1st rifle, 2nd rifle, 3rd rifle and 4th rifle. Archery being the lowest success due to the range restriction and 4th season the highest due to the compacting of the herds due to migration but weather can always be a factor in elk hunting.\nMany reasons for the wide span are buck fever. Many hunters get it on deer. When you have an animal 3 times the size of a deer it is extremely apparent you must, must focus on the shoulder not the antlers when you shoot. We have antlers shot off many times because of this. I spoke with a hunter that didn't fill and he had shot 20 rounds, at 5 different bulls, 1 at 90 yards standing broad side and never hit an elk.\nThe other reason is many are short range ground blind whitetail hunters. The farthest they have ever shot is 50 yards in eastern whitetail states. Because of this a 300 or even 200 yard shot is out of the question. We have had them refuse to shoot an elk standing at 200 yards because they felt it was too far. If they do shoot they shoot that far standing up instead of with a rest or better yet laying down.\nI recommend everyone to shoot a 300 yards target before coming out west. An elk is huge with a chance twice the size of a deer. (15x15 vs 36x36) so in theory shooting an elk at 200 years is like shooting a deer at 100 yards. If you can do well on paper at 300 yards you will be one of the 75% not the 25%. I also recommend shooting laying down on the ground this skill is difficult for many to lay down on the ground when hunting but this or to some degree with a rest is an important skill to build. Finally getting from a walking position to down on the ground in a solid position with shooting sticks low or resting the forearm of the rifle on a solid rest is a times even with elk hunting. You only have so much time to get from walking to pulling the trigger before the bull moves of out of sight. These are free ranging elk not high fence elk. They will do everything possible for them to be difficult to shoot, and for that we have no control but will do our best to give you an opportunity for a shot.\nI have personally hunted in this area for 35 years and never gone home without a elk. You can't find a denser population in the world then the private land you will be hunting in an area known as the elk capitol of the world. Even the public land elk move into the already high number on the private land as soon as the first shot is fired. The lead cow has been doing it for 15 years and they keep doing it generation after generations because it get so little pressure in comparison to the public land which is wall to wall blaze orange. The public land hunter does a good job of moving even more elk than we already have into our private property. Our private property is pre-scouted before the hunts and local herds spotted. Those have the public land herd by noon on the 1st day. Moving elk are a easier target than the local herds because they are not as familiar with the private property escape routes, while your guide is. If the elk are moving they are everywhere. Just like deer though if they decide to lay down and hold up they will still be there but must be spotted in their beds unless they get up to feed or migrate.\nWould allow us to bring a self-contained RV to stay in on the property is a question we get asked but due to the fire danger during the hunting season which is usually announced by the forest service is extreme camping of any type is not allowed on the property. Better yet though is in the town of Craig is a KOA camp ground dedicated to hunters in the fall. It has a large game pole, for skinning and hanging you elk to cool. They provide anything that relates to hanging deer and elk along with hunting.\n.\nThis outfitter books up early each year so by now some slots are already filled.\nThank-you\nGreg\nKeep-m the point required in your mind when you put in for a license this year. You can put in for an elk point then get a elk license over the counter when you arrive in Colorado for the 2nd or 3rd seasons.\nIf you would like to shoot a mule deer there is only about a 50% chance of drawing one for private land with no points and you will be running into deer all day when you are elk hunting. I recommend putting in for a deer point this year so you will have one for next year or if you do want to hunt deer with your elk this year then put in for a deer and you will automatically either draw or get a point.

There are only 2 hunts per year on 20,000 acres of private land. You can anticipate a 20-28\" wide buck or bigger. It is the beginning of the rut and the big timber bucks are coming down to the lower altitudes but the rut and pushed by winter. The hunt is the last 4 days of the 3rd season usually beginning around the 5th of November. Weather can rush the rut or retard it depend on Mother Nature. The hunter will need to provide the license either by a draw or buy a voucher to be able to get the license.

From here you can drive to any place in the United States or even fly there. You are not only in the place where you hunt in the highest elk density in the world but you are in the legendary elk capitol of the United States, the famous Craig Colorado. From this town of 10,000 people draw an imaginary 100 mile circle and you will not find anywhere that a circle of this size can encompass so many elk. The NW corner of the state is home to over half of the states 375,000 elk. If you come to Craig to see people you may as well stay home. \u003cbr/\u003e\nIf you came here to see elk don't waste another minute come see where the elk are made and the highest elk density in the world wraps around you like the glamor of nature at its finest. Colorado is home to the largest elk population in the world and within this big game hunting mecca, Moffat County boasts to two of the largest migratory elk herds in North America and is also a hunting hot spot for deer, antelope and small game. With over 20,000 acres to hunt on 7 different ranches you will be swimming in prime private land and enjoying the success it provides. \u003cbr/\u003e\nThat is important to an elk hunter but there continues to be more as Craig unfolds to welcome you in to the hunt of your life. Craig is a bustling town with an extremely strong pro guns attitude that is as strong as its pro-hunting attitude that is extremely refreshing in today's world. Friendly town it is, don't hesitate to say high when you meet someone on the street, they will certainly say hi back. The area is known for its record class Mule deer and not to be slighted the pronghorn Antelope that thrive here have the very rare genes to be able to put the sportsman that kills one in the Boone and Crockett or Pope and Young record book, not to mention SCI's book also.\u003cbr/\u003e\nTo hunt here you will want to be with a local, some one that was born and raised here living among these great animals and hunting them at a young age. Then becoming so proficient received his outfitting license early on and has many years of outfitting and guiding to show and build his skill and animal knowledge.\u003cbr/\u003e\nThis is your outfitter, a man that has probably seen more elk drop at a shot then most of us have ever seen anywhere at any time. His properties are vast and lay game full in in units GMU003, GMU301, and GMU441. Notice the unique regulation for GMU004 and GMU441 for archers. In those 2 GMU's have a unique archery clause? To hunt public land you must draw the license with the additional clause that states that if you are hunting Private Land in GMU004 and 441 you can use a over the counter archery license. This hunt is conducted on 20,000 acres of private land, so the over the counter archery license is valid for this hunt. Note many people are confused by this clause because it is unique to only about 5 units in the state.\u003cbr/\u003e\nIf you are in question feel free to contact the Colorado Parks and Wildlife at\n\u003ca class=\"showcontact\" href=\"/fb/csd/spo/5317898403\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"click to show contact info\"\u003eshow contact info\u003c/a\u003e\nfor confirmation. GMU003 and 301 is an archery over the counter private or public as most of the units are at this time. Colorado has some of the most complex license application in the nation, rules like this make up that complexity.\u003cbr/\u003e\nEarly seasons, September finds the elk in the high country for rut in GMU004 and GMU441. They will be dodging arrows and muzzleloader bullets as they hear the cow coal of many new ladies and the bugles of bulls that have never been heard in these parts as the archers and muzzleloader hunters try to mystify or harass the love sick bull to come within range of their primitive weapons.\u003cbr/\u003e\nWhen mid-August rolls out of the summer heat the archers and their tent blinds on waterholes begin to pop up like mushroom after a heavy rain. The antelope hunting all takes place in the flat to rolling terrain of GMU003 and GMU301. This is a great \"Low Impact\" hunt, one for the youth for his first big game animal or a senior citizen that has not given up and want to hunt with him boys and shoot antelope, the time and the success together will be cherished for the years that make up the rest of their lives.\u003cbr/\u003e\nWith September just a memory the Pronghorn antelope slips in under the cover of darkness during the 1st week in October and they are greeted by the antelope hunters toting rifles and the only tents by the water holes are the ones that the hunters are camped in during this usually mild weather.\u003cbr/\u003e\nThe deer and elk stay for the most part in the cooler temperatures in GMU004 and GMU441 for their archer, muzzleloader and first couple of gun seasons before the slowly migrate down to the Craig Valley floor where some will spend the winter and others continue south to the Yampa River Valley and Axel basin to spend the winter.\u003cbr/\u003e\nThis outfitter learned this migration pattern at an early age and knew that you had to have mountain private land as well as land in the valley if you wanted to hunt all three animals during all seasons.\u003cbr/\u003e\nThis is exactly what you will be hunting, where the animals that you have a license for are at the time of your season. Not be told \"they are not here yet, or they are below us like many are told each year by other outfitters. The words to remember,\" Don't miss the Flow!\"\u003cbr/\u003e\nThese hunts are all about having a safe and good hunt with a guide and outfitter that have lived here most if not all of their lives hunting and guiding this honey hole of hunting. The hunt includes the hunt, guided to the degree of semi-guided with both of you having the same goal, that is to meet the large Rocky Mountain Elk, the largest of the species face to face on his terms and to see who wins the right to brag or eat crow the next day depending on the outcome of the contacted opportunity. \u003cbr/\u003e\nLodging and meals are the hunters responsibility and the outfitter will provide you with motel phone numbers in Crag that he recommends for his hunters and where you will all meet for breakfast early the first morning to head out in the darkness together after plans with maps, guides and hunters all in the loop. This is the first day of the rest of your life. You are going out west on a famous Colorado elk hunt that will build memories that data confirms that hunters enjoy enough that they return year after year.\u003cbr/\u003e\nYou will be required to meet the outfitter at a prearranged location at a specific time early in the morning to start your hunt. If you are late and every one had gone stay in your car with your cell phone and depending on how the day goes they might be able to get back to you. Do not go in the property without the outfitter or guides knowledge.\u003cbr/\u003e\nTime has taught him about people or hunters. It is not a first time hunt for many and they mainly need access to private land where a \"Land Stewart\" has protected the land and made certain that the animals you are after are there when you get there.\u003cbr/\u003e\nHe does no advertise his hunts as 1 on 1 or 2 on 1 hunting, instead it is 3, 4 or even 5 on 1 hunting. This depends on the season and the number of hunters hunting that hunt. If you do want a 1 on 1 or a 2 on 1 there will be a price increase to provide that service. He provides a closer attentiveness to the newer hunter while allowing the more veteran hunters more leeway. If necessary the guide can work elk to the hunters but his only requirement is to check on the hunters once per day. As a norm he will assist you in elk hunting knowledge to direct you to the best places to be, hunt or sit depending on the time of year and where the elk are traveling. He is required by the landowners to always be with the group when anyone is hunting on the land. There is no DIY hunting allowed. He is very skilled and knowledgeable about hunting and hunters and as ones fill put more effort into the ones that have not filled. . . yet.\u003cbr/\u003e\nSome ask about the success rate for elk for the outfitter for the last few years. The success average across the 6 seasons varies every year due to the weather. Elk are very weather dependent for their migration. A good average is 60-75% harvest with 99.9 have at least 1 opportunity during the 5 day season, Archery, Muzzleloader, 1st rifle, 2nd rifle, 3rd rifle and 4th rifle. Archery being the lowest success due to the range restriction and 4th season the highest due to the compacting of the herds due to migration but weather can always be a factor in elk hunting.\u003cbr/\u003e\nMany reasons for the wide span are buck fever. Many hunters get it on deer. When you have an animal 3 times the size of a deer it is extremely apparent you must, must focus on the shoulder not the antlers when you shoot. We have antlers shot off many times because of this. I spoke with a hunter that didn't fill and he had shot 20 rounds, at 5 different bulls, 1 at 90 yards standing broad side and never hit an elk.\u003cbr/\u003e\nThe other reason is many are short range ground blind whitetail hunters. The farthest they have ever shot is 50 yards in eastern whitetail states. Because of this a 300 or even 200 yard shot is out of the question. We have had them refuse to shoot an elk standing at 200 yards because they felt it was too far. If they do shoot they shoot that far standing up instead of with a rest or better yet laying down.\u003cbr/\u003e\nI recommend everyone to shoot a 300 yards target before coming out west. An elk is huge with a chance twice the size of a deer. (15x15 vs 36x36) so in theory shooting an elk at 200 years is like shooting a deer at 100 yards. If you can do well on paper at 300 yards you will be one of the 75% not the 25%. I also recommend shooting laying down on the ground this skill is difficult for many to lay down on the ground when hunting but this or to some degree with a rest is an important skill to build. Finally getting from a walking position to down on the ground in a solid position with shooting sticks low or resting the forearm of the rifle on a solid rest is a times even with elk hunting. You only have so much time to get from walking to pulling the trigger before the bull moves of out of sight. These are free ranging elk not high fence elk. They will do everything possible for them to be difficult to shoot, and for that we have no control but will do our best to give you an opportunity for a shot.\u003cbr/\u003e\nI have personally hunted in this area for 35 years and never gone home without a elk. You can't find a denser population in the world then the private land you will be hunting in an area known as the elk capitol of the world. Even the public land elk move into the already high number on the private land as soon as the first shot is fired. The lead cow has been doing it for 15 years and they keep doing it generation after generations because it get so little pressure in comparison to the public land which is wall to wall blaze orange. The public land hunter does a good job of moving even more elk than we already have into our private property. Our private property is pre-scouted before the hunts and local herds spotted. Those have the public land herd by noon on the 1st day. Moving elk are a easier target than the local herds because they are not as familiar with the private property escape routes, while your guide is. If the elk are moving they are everywhere. Just like deer though if they decide to lay down and hold up they will still be there but must be spotted in their beds unless they get up to feed or migrate.\u003cbr/\u003e\nWould allow us to bring a self-contained RV to stay in on the property is a question we get asked but due to the fire danger during the hunting season which is usually announced by the forest service is extreme camping of any type is not allowed on the property. Better yet though is in the town of Craig is a KOA camp ground dedicated to hunters in the fall. It has a large game pole, for skinning and hanging you elk to cool. They provide anything that relates to hanging deer and elk along with hunting.\u003cbr/\u003e\n.\u003cbr/\u003e\nThis outfitter books up early each year so by now some slots are already filled.\u003cbr/\u003e\nThank-you\u003cbr/\u003e\nGreg\u003cbr/\u003e\nKeep-m the point required in your mind when you put in for a license this year. You can put in for an elk point then get a elk license over the counter when you arrive in Colorado for the 2nd or 3rd seasons.\u003cbr/\u003e\nIf you would like to shoot a mule deer there is only about a 50% chance of drawing one for private land with no points and you will be running into deer all day when you are elk hunting. I recommend putting in for a deer point this year so you will have one for next year or if you do want to hunt deer with your elk this year then put in for a deer and you will automatically either draw or get a point.

From here you can drive to any place in the United States or even fly there. You are not only in the place where you hunt in the highest elk density in the world but you are in the legendary elk capitol of the United States, the famous Craig Colorado. From this town of 10,000 people draw an imaginary 100 mile circle and you will not find anywhere that a circle of this size can encompass so many elk. The NW corner of the state is home to over half of the states 375,000 elk. If you come to Craig to see people you may as well stay home. \nIf you came here to see elk don't waste another minute come see where the elk are made and the highest elk density in the world wraps around you like the glamor of nature at its finest. Colorado is home to the largest elk population in the world and within this big game hunting mecca, Moffat County boasts to two of the largest migratory elk herds in North America and is also a hunting hot spot for deer, antelope and small game. With over 20,000 acres to hunt on 7 different ranches you will be swimming in prime private land and enjoying the success it provides. \nThat is important to an elk hunter but there continues to be more as Craig unfolds to welcome you in to the hunt of your life. Craig is a bustling town with an extremely strong pro guns attitude that is as strong as its pro-hunting attitude that is extremely refreshing in today's world. Friendly town it is, don't hesitate to say high when you meet someone on the street, they will certainly say hi back. The area is known for its record class Mule deer and not to be slighted the pronghorn Antelope that thrive here have the very rare genes to be able to put the sportsman that kills one in the Boone and Crockett or Pope and Young record book, not to mention SCI's book also.\nTo hunt here you will want to be with a local, some one that was born and raised here living among these great animals and hunting them at a young age. Then becoming so proficient received his outfitting license early on and has many years of outfitting and guiding to show and build his skill and animal knowledge.\nThis is your outfitter, a man that has probably seen more elk drop at a shot then most of us have ever seen anywhere at any time. His properties are vast and lay game full in in units GMU003, GMU301, and GMU441. Notice the unique regulation for GMU004 and GMU441 for archers. In those 2 GMU's have a unique archery clause? To hunt public land you must draw the license with the additional clause that states that if you are hunting Private Land in GMU004 and 441 you can use a over the counter archery license. This hunt is conducted on 20,000 acres of private land, so the over the counter archery license is valid for this hunt. Note many people are confused by this clause because it is unique to only about 5 units in the state.\nIf you are in question feel free to contact the Colorado Parks and Wildlife at\nshow contact info\nfor confirmation. GMU003 and 301 is an archery over the counter private or public as most of the units are at this time. Colorado has some of the most complex license application in the nation, rules like this make up that complexity.\nEarly seasons, September finds the elk in the high country for rut in GMU004 and GMU441. They will be dodging arrows and muzzleloader bullets as they hear the cow coal of many new ladies and the bugles of bulls that have never been heard in these parts as the archers and muzzleloader hunters try to mystify or harass the love sick bull to come within range of their primitive weapons.\nWhen mid-August rolls out of the summer heat the archers and their tent blinds on waterholes begin to pop up like mushroom after a heavy rain. The antelope hunting all takes place in the flat to rolling terrain of GMU003 and GMU301. This is a great \"Low Impact\" hunt, one for the youth for his first big game animal or a senior citizen that has not given up and want to hunt with him boys and shoot antelope, the time and the success together will be cherished for the years that make up the rest of their lives.\nWith September just a memory the Pronghorn antelope slips in under the cover of darkness during the 1st week in October and they are greeted by the antelope hunters toting rifles and the only tents by the water holes are the ones that the hunters are camped in during this usually mild weather.\nThe deer and elk stay for the most part in the cooler temperatures in GMU004 and GMU441 for their archer, muzzleloader and first couple of gun seasons before the slowly migrate down to the Craig Valley floor where some will spend the winter and others continue south to the Yampa River Valley and Axel basin to spend the winter.\nThis outfitter learned this migration pattern at an early age and knew that you had to have mountain private land as well as land in the valley if you wanted to hunt all three animals during all seasons.\nThis is exactly what you will be hunting, where the animals that you have a license for are at the time of your season. Not be told \"they are not here yet, or they are below us like many are told each year by other outfitters. The words to remember,\" Don't miss the Flow!\"\nThese hunts are all about having a safe and good hunt with a guide and outfitter that have lived here most if not all of their lives hunting and guiding this honey hole of hunting. The hunt includes the hunt, guided to the degree of semi-guided with both of you having the same goal, that is to meet the large Rocky Mountain Elk, the largest of the species face to face on his terms and to see who wins the right to brag or eat crow the next day depending on the outcome of the contacted opportunity. \nLodging and meals are the hunters responsibility and the outfitter will provide you with motel phone numbers in Crag that he recommends for his hunters and where you will all meet for breakfast early the first morning to head out in the darkness together after plans with maps, guides and hunters all in the loop. This is the first day of the rest of your life. You are going out west on a famous Colorado elk hunt that will build memories that data confirms that hunters enjoy enough that they return year after year.\nYou will be required to meet the outfitter at a prearranged location at a specific time early in the morning to start your hunt. If you are late and every one had gone stay in your car with your cell phone and depending on how the day goes they might be able to get back to you. Do not go in the property without the outfitter or guides knowledge.\nTime has taught him about people or hunters. It is not a first time hunt for many and they mainly need access to private land where a \"Land Stewart\" has protected the land and made certain that the animals you are after are there when you get there.\nHe does no advertise his hunts as 1 on 1 or 2 on 1 hunting, instead it is 3, 4 or even 5 on 1 hunting. This depends on the season and the number of hunters hunting that hunt. If you do want a 1 on 1 or a 2 on 1 there will be a price increase to provide that service. He provides a closer attentiveness to the newer hunter while allowing the more veteran hunters more leeway. If necessary the guide can work elk to the hunters but his only requirement is to check on the hunters once per day. As a norm he will assist you in elk hunting knowledge to direct you to the best places to be, hunt or sit depending on the time of year and where the elk are traveling. He is required by the landowners to always be with the group when anyone is hunting on the land. There is no DIY hunting allowed. He is very skilled and knowledgeable about hunting and hunters and as ones fill put more effort into the ones that have not filled. . . yet.\nSome ask about the success rate for elk for the outfitter for the last few years. The success average across the 6 seasons varies every year due to the weather. Elk are very weather dependent for their migration. A good average is 60-75% harvest with 99.9 have at least 1 opportunity during the 5 day season, Archery, Muzzleloader, 1st rifle, 2nd rifle, 3rd rifle and 4th rifle. Archery being the lowest success due to the range restriction and 4th season the highest due to the compacting of the herds due to migration but weather can always be a factor in elk hunting.\nMany reasons for the wide span are buck fever. Many hunters get it on deer. When you have an animal 3 times the size of a deer it is extremely apparent you must, must focus on the shoulder not the antlers when you shoot. We have antlers shot off many times because of this. I spoke with a hunter that didn't fill and he had shot 20 rounds, at 5 different bulls, 1 at 90 yards standing broad side and never hit an elk.\nThe other reason is many are short range ground blind whitetail hunters. The farthest they have ever shot is 50 yards in eastern whitetail states. Because of this a 300 or even 200 yard shot is out of the question. We have had them refuse to shoot an elk standing at 200 yards because they felt it was too far. If they do shoot they shoot that far standing up instead of with a rest or better yet laying down.\nI recommend everyone to shoot a 300 yards target before coming out west. An elk is huge with a chance twice the size of a deer. (15x15 vs 36x36) so in theory shooting an elk at 200 years is like shooting a deer at 100 yards. If you can do well on paper at 300 yards you will be one of the 75% not the 25%. I also recommend shooting laying down on the ground this skill is difficult for many to lay down on the ground when hunting but this or to some degree with a rest is an important skill to build. Finally getting from a walking position to down on the ground in a solid position with shooting sticks low or resting the forearm of the rifle on a solid rest is a times even with elk hunting. You only have so much time to get from walking to pulling the trigger before the bull moves of out of sight. These are free ranging elk not high fence elk. They will do everything possible for them to be difficult to shoot, and for that we have no control but will do our best to give you an opportunity for a shot.\nI have personally hunted in this area for 35 years and never gone home without a elk. You can't find a denser population in the world then the private land you will be hunting in an area known as the elk capitol of the world. Even the public land elk move into the already high number on the private land as soon as the first shot is fired. The lead cow has been doing it for 15 years and they keep doing it generation after generations because it get so little pressure in comparison to the public land which is wall to wall blaze orange. The public land hunter does a good job of moving even more elk than we already have into our private property. Our private property is pre-scouted before the hunts and local herds spotted. Those have the public land herd by noon on the 1st day. Moving elk are a easier target than the local herds because they are not as familiar with the private property escape routes, while your guide is. If the elk are moving they are everywhere. Just like deer though if they decide to lay down and hold up they will still be there but must be spotted in their beds unless they get up to feed or migrate.\nWould allow us to bring a self-contained RV to stay in on the property is a question we get asked but due to the fire danger during the hunting season which is usually announced by the forest service is extreme camping of any type is not allowed on the property. Better yet though is in the town of Craig is a KOA camp ground dedicated to hunters in the fall. It has a large game pole, for skinning and hanging you elk to cool. They provide anything that relates to hanging deer and elk along with hunting.\n.\nThis outfitter books up early each year so by now some slots are already filled.\nThank-you\nGreg\nKeep-m the point required in your mind when you put in for a license this year. You can put in for an elk point then get a elk license over the counter when you arrive in Colorado for the 2nd or 3rd seasons.\nIf you would like to shoot a mule deer there is only about a 50% chance of drawing one for private land with no points and you will be running into deer all day when you are elk hunting. I recommend putting in for a deer point this year so you will have one for next year or if you do want to hunt deer with your elk this year then put in for a deer and you will automatically either draw or get a point. Ask Greg for details on how you can build your points and hunt the best areas every year.\nGMU003 \u0026 GMU301 hunting opportunities/Dates are approximate\nDeer Seasons and Preference Points to Draw\nArchery Either sex 0 points 08/31-09/29 \nMuzzleloader Buck 2 points Doe 0 points 09/14-9/22 \n1st Rifle Buck 0 Doe 0 None\n2nd Rifle Buck 0 and doe 0 10/19-10-27 \n2nd Rifle PL Either sex 0 and Doe 0 10/19-10-27\n3rd Rifle PL Either sex 0 11/02-11/10 \n3rd Rifle SPECIFY Buck or Doe 0 points 11/02-11/10\n4th Rifle Buck Only 5 preference points 11/13-11/17 \nPossible left over licenses in some categories announced in July and sold first come first serve in August\n\nElk\nArchery Bull, Cow or either 0 Points 08/31-09/29\nMuzzleloader Either Sex 0 points or Cow 0 points 09/14-9/22\nEarly Season Cow 1 point 10/12-10/16\n1ST PL Cow 0 Points 10/12-10/16\n1st Rifle Cow 0 Points either sex 0 Points 10/12-10/16\n2nd Rifle Cow 0 points Bull Over the counter 10/19-10-27\n3rd Rifle Cow 0 Points Bull over the Counter 11/02-11/10 \n4th Rifle Cow 0 points 0 Points 11/13-11/17 \nLate Cow 2 Points 12/01-12/31 \nPossible left over licenses in some categories announced in July and sold first come first serve in August\n\n\nAntelope\nARCHERY Buck 3 Points Doe 0 points 08/15-09/20 \nMuzzleloader Buck 8 Points and Doe 1 Point 10/21-10/29\nREGULAR Buck 13 Doe 1 point 10/06-10/12 \nRifle PL Buck 0 and Doe 0 Point 10/06-10/12 \nIn the regulations on page 31 bottom right corner of the page is:\n\"These Licenses are valid on private land in units 4,5,12,23,24,33 and 441.\" \nThis is referring to, \"OVER-THE-COUNTER LICENSES EITHER-SEX ELK-ARCHERY\"\nin the bottom left corner of the page.\n\n-----------\n\nGMU004 \u0026 GMU441 hunting opportunities/Dates are approximate\n\nMuzzleloader is grouped with 3 for GMU004 \u0026 441\nArchery is grouped with 3 for GMU004 \u0026 441\n\n\nDeer Seasons and Preference Points to Draw\nArchery Either sex 0 points 08/31-09/29 \nMuzzleloader Buck 2 points 0 points 09/14-9/22 \n1st Rifle Buck 0 None\n2nd Rifle Buck 0 points 0 points 10/19-10-27 \n2nd Rifle PL Either sex 0 points 0 points 10/19-10-27\n3rd Rifle PL Either sex 0 points 0 points 11/02-11/10 \n3rd Rifle Buck 0 points 1 points 11/02-11/10\n4th Rifle Buck 5 points 12 points 11/13-11/17 \nPossible left over licenses in some categories announced in July and sold first come first serve in August\n\nElk\nArchery Bull, Cow or either 0 Points 08/31-09/29\nMuzzleloader Either Sex 0 points or Cow 0 points 09/14-9/22\nEarly Season Cow 1 point 10/12-10/16\n1ST PL Cow 0 Points 10/12-10/16\n1st Rifle Cow 0 Points either sex 0 Points 10/12-10/16\n2nd Rifle Cow 0 points Bull Over the counter 10/19-10-27\n3rd Rifle Cow 0 Points Bull over the Counter 11/02-11/10 \n4th Rifle Cow 0 points 0 Points 11/13-11/17 \nLate Cow 2 Points 12/01-12/31 \nPossible left over licenses in some categories announced in July and sold first come first serve in August\n\n\nAntelope\nARCHERY Buck 1 point 2 points 08/15-09/20 \nMuzzleloader Buck 1 Points 1 Point 10/21-10/29\nREGULAR Buck 1 Points 1 Point 10/06-10/12 \nRifle PL Buck 1 point 2 Point 10/06-10/12 \n\n\n\nHistorical Leftover licenses after the License Application Draw.\nDEER ELK ANTELOPE \nDF004P5A EF003O2R None\nEF00303R\nEM00304R\nEM00404R\nEF004P1M\nAlso 2nd and 3rd season Bull Elk Licenses are available over the counter.\n\n* Indicate the seasons that can be hunted on this property.\n\nPossible left over licenses in some categories announced in July and sold first come first serve in August.\n\nIn all 4 units there is archery, muzzleloader, 1, 2, 3 and 4 hunting season.

There are only 2 hunts per year on 20,000 acres of private land. You can anticipate a 20-28\" wide buck or bigger. It is the beginning of the rut and the big timber bucks are coming down to the lower altitudes but the rut and pushed by winter. The hunt is the last 4 days of the 3rd season usually beginning around the 5th of November. Weather can rush the rut or retard it depend on Mother Nature. The hunter will need to provide the license either by a draw or buy a voucher to be able to get the license. Landowner Voucher usually runs about $ 1700 when available for Deer and about $1000 for antelope.\n\n\n2nd and 3rd season are 5 and 4 day hunt with the 2nd half of each season being discounted $300\n\nIf you want to hunt a cow elk during the regular bull seasons with a bull hunter the cost is $ 1000.\n\n* EOS is End of Season, being the last 4 days of a 9 day season as 2nd and 3rd season.\n\n\nBig Game Season Dates and Fees\n2015 Big Game Season Dates- Check the regulation brochures for more specifics and variations\nArchery\n\nDeer/elk (west of I-25 and Unit 140)\nAug. 29--Sept. 27\n\nPlains deer (east of I-25, except Unit 140) \nOct. 1--23 \n\nNov. 4--30 \n\nDec. 15--31\n\nMoose\nSept. 12--27\n\nPronghorn (bucks only)\nAug. 15--31\n\nPronghorn (either sex)\nSept. 1--20\n\nMuzzleloader (by draw only)\n\nDeer/elk/moose\nSept. 12--20\n\nPlains deer (east of I-25, except Unit 140)\nOct. 10--18\n\nPronghorn\nSept. 21--29\n\nRifle Deer/Elk/Moose\n\nMoose\nOct. 1--14\n\nSeparate limited elk (1st season)\nOct. 10--14\n\nCombined (deer/elk) (2nd season)\nOct. 17--25\n\n(3rd season)\nOct. 31-Nov.8\nCombined limited (deer/elk) (4th season)\nNov. 11--15\n\nPlains deer (east of I-25, except Unit 140)\nOct. 24--Nov. 3\n\nLate plains deer (east of I-25, except Unit 140)\nDec. 1--14\n\nRifle Pronghorn (by draw only)\n\nPronghorn\nOct. 3--9\n\nBlack Bear\n\nRifle limited (by draw)\nSept. 2--30\n\nArchery (over-the-counter with caps)\nSept. 2--30\n\nMuzzleloading (over-the-counter with caps)\u0009Sept. 12--20\n\nRifle (over-the-counter with caps)\nconcurrent with deer/elk rifle seasons\n\n\n\n2015 Colorado Hunting License Fees\nHabitat Stamps \n(non-refundable)\nResident\nNonresident\n\nHabitat Stamp (valid 4/1--3/31)\n$ 10\n$ 10\n\nLifetime Habitat Stamp\n$ 300.25\n$ 300.25\n\nLicenses Fees \n(Note: When applying for a license, an additional $3 non-refundable fee must be submitted with payment.)\n\nElk, Cow\n$ 46\n$ 461\n\nElk, Bull or Either Sex\n$ 46\n$ 616\n\nDeer\n$ 31\n$ 371\n\nMoose\n$ 251\n$ 2,061\n\nPronghorn, Buck or Doe\n$ 31\n$ 371\n\nBear\n$ 41\n$ 351\n\n*License Fees include a 25-cent search \u0026 rescue fee and a 75-cent Wildlife Education surcharge. *All non-resident big game licenses are a big game and annual fishing combination license.\n\n\n\nGreg Merriam\nMaster Hunt Broker\nMaster Land Owner Voucher Broker\nDiscounted Hunts LLC\nOutdoor Writers LLC\nPro-Staff Dead Down Wind Scent Products\nPro-Staff Benchmaster Shooting Accuracy Products \n1204 Button Rock Drive \nLongmont, Co 80504\nshow contact info\nVoice\nshow contact info\nCell Phone \n\nWeb Page: http://www.discountedhunts.net\nWeb Page for Vouchers This is the Link to the land Owner Voucher List\n\nThis is Antelope Hunting info This is Mule Deer Hunting info \nThis is Elk Hunting info This is Whitetail Deer Hunting info \n\nClick on the Photo on the left to find where trophy \nDeer and Elk are located, we know because we take many each year.

Our product line includes several varieties of wood flooring, wall boards, ceilings, tin, old hand hewed beams, fireplace mantles \u0026amp; shelves, trim and decor. And, if we don't have it we can probably find it or make it for you! Remember that \"reclaimed\" means eco-friendly--- by reusing old building materials and not cutting down more forests. We are a small husband and wife business that has partnered with an Amish sawmill that produces all of our wood building products without the use of any electric. Every piece of wood is personally handled and inspected by the Amish. It's hard to beat the quality of the reclaimed barn wood products that we offer. You can depend on knowledgeable, friendly, personal service from Kentucky Kreations. We manage our business using an old-fashioned approach. . . no fancy (impersonal) web site, a real person answers the phone (and you don't have to press #1 for English) and we accept cash or personal checks (no credit cards.) Using the old-fashioned sales approach allows us to keep our prices as low as possible. Depending on location and project size, there is the option of our professional installation services.

We ship nationwide!\u003cbr/\u003e\nKentucky Kreations Reclaimed Barn Wood Flooring\u003cbr/\u003e\nThe Amish reclaim barn wood from tobacco barns and outbuildings in Kentucky, Ohio and Indiana. Wood flooring planks are milled with back relief and are tongued on one side and grooved on the other. All but our chestnut flooring is ¾\" thick. Each plank is end trimmed. The flooring is kiln dried which eliminates odor, insects and most moisture (6% to 8%) to prevent shrinkage after installation. Many wood flooring manufactures only kiln dry to 10-12% moisture content.\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\nOur beautiful reclaimed barn wood flooring will have some old worm holes, surface cracks, nail holes and knot holes that give the wood that old patina appearance but that does not take away the floorings durability and beauty. In fact, it adds to the natural beauty of the wood. Installation ideas include laying the floor planks end-to-end and side-to-side like most conventional flooring or in an endless variety of designs. Once the floor is finely sanded and a protective floor finish is applied, you will be astonished by the various natural colors and textures. Each floor will is uniquely different from any other floor, with a durable beauty that will last for decades. You can't get that from mass produced wood flooring. . .\u003cbr/\u003e\nWe offer wood flooring in a smooth top surface or skip plane top surface. Skip plane is a favorite of our customers because it shows the saw marks and some of the old barn wood patina. Each flooring order is custom made and there is a wait time. Give us a call and we will be happy to answer any questions. If we are out installing flooring or beams, sometimes we aren't able to answer the phone so please leave a message.

Our product line includes several varieties of wood flooring, wall boards, ceilings, tin, old hand hewed beams, fireplace mantles \u0026 shelves, trim and decor. And, if we don't have it we can probably find it or make it for you! Remember that \"reclaimed\" means eco-friendly--- by reusing old building materials and not cutting down more forests. We are a small husband and wife business that has partnered with an Amish sawmill that produces all of our wood building products without the use of any electric. Every piece of wood is personally handled and inspected by the Amish. It's hard to beat the quality of the reclaimed barn wood products that we offer. You can depend on knowledgeable, friendly, personal service from Kentucky Kreations. We manage our business using an old-fashioned approach. . . no fancy (impersonal) web site, a real person answers the phone (and you don't have to press #1 for English) and we accept cash or personal checks (no credit cards.) Using the old-fashioned sales approach allows us to keep our prices as low as possible. Depending on location and project size, there is the option of our professional installation services. If you are planning a building or remodeling project, we would be happy to give you an estimate and answer questions. We ship nationwide!\nKentucky Kreations Reclaimed Barn Wood Flooring\nThe Amish reclaim barn wood from tobacco barns and outbuildings in Kentucky, Ohio and Indiana. Wood flooring planks are milled with back relief and are tongued on one side and grooved on the other. All but our chestnut flooring is ¾\" thick. Each plank is end trimmed. The flooring is kiln dried which eliminates odor, insects and most moisture (6% to 8%) to prevent shrinkage after installation. Many wood flooring manufactures only kiln dry to 10-12% moisture content.\n\nOur beautiful reclaimed barn wood flooring will have some old worm holes, surface cracks, nail holes and knot holes that give the wood that old patina appearance but that does not take away the floorings durability and beauty. In fact, it adds to the natural beauty of the wood. Installation ideas include laying the floor planks end-to-end and side-to-side like most conventional flooring or in an endless variety of designs. Once the floor is finely sanded and a protective floor finish is applied, you will be astonished by the various natural colors and textures. Each floor will is uniquely different from any other floor, with a durable beauty that will last for decades. You can't get that from mass produced wood flooring. . .\nWe offer wood flooring in a smooth top surface or skip plane top surface. Skip plane is a favorite of our customers because it shows the saw marks and some of the old barn wood patina. Each flooring order is custom made and there is a wait time. Give us a call and we will be happy to answer any questions. If we are out installing flooring or beams, sometimes we aren't able to answer the phone so please leave a message.
