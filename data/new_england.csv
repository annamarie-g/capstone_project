This is a beautifully framed lithograph. It needs to be seen in person to appreciate. This is a high quality print from when the artist was still alive. It may be from 1941, the year he did the actual work. Currently, The Met offers a print of this work framed for $220.00 plus tax and plus shipping It is not framed as nicely as mine. I also would doubt the quality is anywhere near this one. Go to their website and check them out, or just Google the title.
